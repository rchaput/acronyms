  Learn how to use the new shortcode syntax.
---

From version 2.0.0, **acronyms** now uses the Quarto shortcode syntax (in
addition to its legacy filter syntax).

Shortcodes are clearer to use, and may have additional keyworded-arguments that
can be used to override the behaviour described in the [options.qmd](Options)
(which are the same for all acronyms in a given document). For example, a
specific acronym may use a different style than the others.

This article describes this new syntax, how to use the shortcodes, the
arguments that can be used, and gives a few example.


## The `acronym` shortcode

The `{{< acronym KEY >}}` shortcode replaces an acronym in the document, where
`KEY` identifies the acronym we want to replace (exactly as `\acr{KEY}` does
in the legacy syntax).

For convenience, the shorter `{{< acr KEY >}}` can be used instead; both will
invoke the same function, and thus have the same arguments and behaviour.

The key is mandatory, and **acronyms** will raise an error if not provided.
In addition, the following arguments can be provided:


### `style`

This argument controls the acronym's style, that is, how it will be replaced.
It must be used similarly to the [options.qmd#style](style option).
Only the current acronym will use this specific style, so it is not recommended
to provide this argument to set the same style for each acronym; prefer using
the metadata option in this case to simplify your workload.

The list of possible values can be found in the [styles.qmd](Styles) article.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  # Acronyms will use the long-short style by default.
  style: long-short
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
---

First use (using default options): {{< acr Qmd >}}

Now we force the long-long style {{< acr Qmd style=long-long >}}

And now we reuse the default style: {{< acr Qmd >}}
```


### `first_use`

In **acronyms**, most style will replace the acronym differently, based on
whether they appear for the first time. For example, a first use may show the
acronym longname, but only the shortname on subsequent uses.
The `first_use` argument can be used to force the "first use" or "subsequent
use" appearance.

For example:

```yaml
---
acronyms:
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
---

Forced next use: {{< acr Qmd first_use=false >}}
```


### `insert_links`

This argument controls whether the acronym will be rendered with a link to
its definition in the List Of Acronyms. This is similar to the
[options.qmd#insert_links](insert_links option). As for the `style` argument,
this only changes the current acronym behaviour; to change all acronyms, prefer
using the option directly.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
---

{{< acr Qmd insert_links=false >}}
```


### `non_existing`

This argument controls the behaviour when an acronym is not found. **acronyms**
may print a warning and render it as a special token, such as `??` (like the
BibTeX default behaviour), or raise an error, depending on the configuration.
Like previous arguments, this one is similar to the
[options.qmd#non_existing](non-existing option), but changes only the current
acronym. Note that it has no impact when the acronym is found.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
---

Note that the following acronym is mis-typed: {{< acr qmd non_existing=error >}}
```


## The `print-acronyms` shortcode

The `{{< print-acronyms >}}` shortcode can be used to generate the List Of
Acronyms (LoA), which lists the acronyms' definitions (exactly as
`\printacronyms` does in the legacy syntax).

It is recommended to disable the automatic generation of the LoA when using
this shortcode, to avoid duplicating the LoA in the resulting document.
It is useful when you want to generate the LoA at some exact place.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  insert_loa: false
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto document
---

# Introduction

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

{{< print-acronyms >}}
```

The LoA can be customized by using the following keyworded arguments:


### `sorting`

This argument controls how the acronyms are sorted when printed in the LoA.
It works similarly to the [options.qmd#sorting](sorting option). See this option
for a list of possible behaviours and accepted values.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  insert_loa: false
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
    - shortname: YAML
      longname: Yaml Ain't Markup Language
---

{{< acr Qmd >}} {{< acr YAML >}}

{{< print-acronyms sorting=alphabetical >}}
```


### `include_unused`

This argument controls whether to include the unused acronyms in the generated
LoA. In the previous example, we had to insert the both acronyms in the document
to make them appear in the LoA; this can be prevented by using this argument.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  insert_loa: false
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
    - shortname: YAML
      longname: Yaml Ain't Markup Language
---

{{< print-acronyms include_unused=true >}}
```


### `title`

This argument controls the title of the generated LoA, similarly to the
[options.qmd#loa_title](loa_title option). When using a shortcode, you will
most likely want to disable this title, and specify the header exactly as
you want directly in the document.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  insert_loa: false
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
---

# My custom title

{{< print-acronyms title="" >}}
```


### `header_classes`

This argument controls the additional classes that are set to the LoA title,
similarly to the [options.qmd#loa_header_classes](loa_header_classes options).
Note that it has no impact when the LoA title is not generated.

For example:

```markdown
---
acronyms:
  insert_loa: false
  keys:
    - shortname: Qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
---

{{< print-acronyms header_classes=.unnumbered >}}
```
