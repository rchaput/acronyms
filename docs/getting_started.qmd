  Learn how to get started with the basics of the **acronyms** extension.
---

The goal of **acronyms** is to provide support for acronyms to Quarto
documents, in a similar way to what [glossaries] achieve for LaTeX.

Basically, it allows you to define a list of acronyms, and to automatically
replace acronyms inside the document.
A list of all defined acronyms along with their definitions is also generated
and inserted.

Using **acronyms** can be done in 3 simple steps:

1. Installing the extension
2. Defining acronyms
3. Using acronyms


## Installing the extension

This extension can be installed through the standard Quarto `add` command:

```sh
quarto add rchaput/acronyms
```

This command will download the latest version and install it locally to your
`_extensions` folder. Please see the official
[Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/managing.html)
for details.

Make sure that your Quarto document(s) contain the following lines in the
YAML metadata, to load the *acronyms* extension:

```yaml
---
filters:
  - acronyms
---
```


## Defining acronyms

Prior to using acronyms in the Quarto document, they must be defined in
the YAML metadata.

An acronym is defined as:

- a *key*, which is used to refer to the acronym throughout the document;
- a *short name*, which is usually the acronym itself;
- a *long name*, which is usually what the acronym stands for.

To make the list less verbose, if the key is not provided, **acronyms**
uses the short name as a default key for the acronym.

The following example defines 2 acronyms:

```yaml
---
acronyms:
  keys:
    - shortname: qmd
      longname: Quarto documents
    - key: yaml
      shortname: YAML
      longname: YAML Ain't Markup Language
---
```


## Using acronyms

Finally, to insert an acronym into the document, simply use `\acr{<KEY>}`,
where `<KEY>` is an acronym's key, as defined in the YAML metadata.

This command will be automatically replaced by **acronyms**. The result
depends on the chosen style (see [styles] for more details). Most
styles will also make a difference between the first use, and the next
occurrences.

By default, **acronymsdown** will replace as follows:

- first use: `<long name> (<short name>)`
- next uses: `<short name>`

The next lines show an example of how **acronymsdown** replaces acronyms
in a document, assuming the acronyms `Rmd` and `yaml` have been defined, as
per the previous example.

```md
\acr{qmd} allow to easily write technical content. \acr{qmd} use \acr{yaml}
for the metadata.
```

> Quarto documents (qmd) allow to easily write technical content. qmd use
> YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) for the metadata.


## Complete example

A complete example showing the previous instructions as a single file can
be found [here][example].


## Next steps

The current vignette gives you the tools for a simple document, using the
(sane) defaults provided by **acronyms**.
However, most of the mechanisms are highly configurable and offer various
options.

Available options are described in [Options][options], and several tutorials
for advanced usages are listed in [Advanced usage][advanced_usage].

[Styles][styles] lists the different styles that can be used, along
with a small example to visualize each of them.
