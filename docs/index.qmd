# We do not need to set the title or description here, as we will use
# the README's content (at the root folder).
# It already includes a header title (h1), so defining one here would
# just be a useless duplicate.
# The only difference it makes is when setting the page's title, which
# appears in the tab. But, for a homepage, simply having the website's title
# is good enough.

# We also specify that the input markdown contains emojis.
