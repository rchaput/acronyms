# Docs

- Maybe we can specify the version next to the title?
  + Pre-render script to read the version from the extension's YAML config file
  + Should we put it directly in the title or in a new field?
    We need to change the template if we want a new field. Apply some CSS...

- Maybe create an icon / logo

- Perhaps build the example in the documentation website
  + Include the source code with https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/tree/master/include-code-files?
  + Difficult to build the example because we do not have access to the acronyms
    extension.

- Enlever `quarto publish`, faire un `render` puis utiliser les actions GitHub
  pour faire un artéfact et déployer les Pages. `publish` requiert de push
  sur la branche `gh-pages`, ce qui déclenche un autre workflow pour build et
  déployer... (donc branche additionnelle + workflow additionnel).

# Features

- Shortcodes

- Books
  Maybe we can support books by adding a `loa_on_different_page` option?
  If the option is set to `false` or `nil`, we assume that the LoA is on the same
    page.
  Otherwise, we must build a link to the specified page, e.g., `[loa.qmd#acr1]`.
  Check first that such manually-built links do work!!

# Bugfixes

-- We want to require the Lua files which are in the same folder.
-- However, as we are invoking this file through Quarto, we do not have control
-- over the `LUA_PATH` environment variable, nor the current working directory.
-- It seems to me that we need to add this current file's directory
-- to the list of searched directories, i.e., `package.path`.
local current_dir = debug.getinfo(1).source:match("@?(.*/)")
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. current_dir .. "/?.lua"

- FIX THE PREVIEW_STYLE !!
