This test shows the "alphabetical-case-insensitive" sorting option.

The List Of Acronyms is sorted based on their key, in a case-insensitive
alphabetical order. For example, considering acronyms with keys  `a`, `B`, and
`c`, the order would be `a, B, c`, whereas a case-sensitive sort would first
group uppercase (`B`) and then lowercase (`a, c`).
