This test demonstrates the "simplified" format for the `fromfile` documents
that allow to define acronyms in a separate YAML file.

The test includes both the original format (in `acronyms_original.yml`)
and the simplified format (in `acronyms_simplified.yml`) to ensure that
both formats are supported: no breaking changes must appear.
