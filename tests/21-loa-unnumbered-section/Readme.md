This test shows how to put the List of Acronyms in an unnumbered section.

The LoA header (title above the LoA itself) has the `loa` class by default,
which does not do anything, but can be used to style the LoA in CSS. In
addition, "extra" classes can be put on the header, to further configure it,
such as `unnumbered`, which will effectively create an unnumbered section.
